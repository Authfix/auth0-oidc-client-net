# Migrating from Version 1.x to 2.0

Version 2.0 of the Auth0 OIDC Client has introduced significant changes for iOS and Android applications to add support for Xamarin Forms. To achieve this, references platform-specific constructs, such as `UIViewController` (iOS) and `Activity` (Android), has been removed. This also means that the way you integrate the Auth0 OIDC Client into your application has changed.

If you have previously used version 1.x of this library in your iOS and Android application, then please refer to the sections below for the changes you need to make to your applications.

## Migrating iOS applications

For iOS applications, in Version 1.x, you had to pass an instance of `UIViewController` to `Auth0ClientOptions`:

```csharp
_client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
{
    Domain = "YOUR DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR CLIENT ID",
    Controller = this
});
```

In Version 2.0, this is not required anymore as we automatically detect the controller initiating the authentication flow. Removing this dependency also allow developers to more easily use the Auth0 OIDC Client in Xamarin Forms applications.

Update the instantiation of `Auth0ClientOptions` to remove the assignment of the `Controller` property, which has been removed:

```cs
_client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
{
    Domain = "YOUR DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR CLIENT ID"
});
```

## Migrating Android applications

For Android applications, in Version 1.x, you had to pass an instance of the current `Activity` to `Auth0ClientOptions`:

```csharp
_client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
{
    Domain = "YOUR DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR CLIENT ID",
    Activity = this
});
```

This was required because the Auth0 OIDC Client called [StartActivity](https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/Android.Content.Context.StartActivity/p/Android.Content.Intent/) on the current `Activity` to launch the web browser. With Version 2.0, we are now using the static `Application.Context` property to launch the browser activity, so there is no requirement to pass this to `Auth0ClientOptions` anymore. Removing this dependency also allow developers to more easily use the Auth0 OIDC Client in Xamarin Forms applications.

Update the instantiation of `Auth0ClientOptions` to remove the assignment of the `Activity` property, which has been removed:

```cs
_client = new Auth0Client(new Auth0ClientOptions
{
    Domain = "YOUR DOMAIN",
    ClientId = "YOUR CLIENT ID"
});
```
